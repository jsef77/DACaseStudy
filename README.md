# DACaseStudy
Data Analysis Case Study

# Project Summary
This is a continuation of a case study project that I worked on during my Data Analytics Advanced course with Avado.

# Goals
I'm treating this as what is essentially a sandbox environment to test and try out new data analyst techniques I learn as I continue to learn.
The ultimate end goal for this case study is to suggest a car to buy based on quantative data for various company scenarios.
